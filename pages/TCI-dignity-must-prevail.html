<div>“Dignity must prevail” – An appeal to do away with non-consensual psychiatric treatment World Mental Health Day – Saturday 10 October 2015</p>
<p>GENEVA (8 October 2015) – The United Nations Special Rapporteurs on the rights of persons with disabilities, Catalina  Devandas-Aguilar, and on the right to health, Dainius Pûras, today called on States to eradicate all forms of non-consensual psychiatric treatment.</p>
<p>Speaking ahead of the World Mental Health Day*, the independent experts urged Governments to put an end to arbitrary detention, forced institutionalisation and forced treatment, in order to ensure that persons with developmental and psychosocial disabilities are treated with dignity and their human rights respected.</p>
<p>“Locked in institutions, tied down with restraints, often in solitary confinement, forcibly injected with drugs and overmedicated, are only few illustrations of the ways in which persons with disabilities, or those perceived to be so, are treated without their consent, with severe consequences for their physical and mental integrity.</p>
<p>Globally, persons with developmental and psychosocial disabilities face discrimination, stigma and marginalization and are subject to emotional and physical abuse in both mental health facilities and the community.  And every year, the rights and dignity of hundreds of thousands of people across the world are violated as a consequence of non-consensual psychiatry interventions.</p>
<p>All too often persons with developmental and psychosocial disabilities are formally or informally destitute of their legal capacity and arbitrarily deprived of their liberty in psychiatric hospitals, other specialized institutions, and other similar settings.</p>
<p>Dignity cannot be compatible with practices of force treatment which may amount to torture. States must halt this situation as a matter of urgency and respect each person’s autonomy, including their right to choose or refuse treatment and care.</p>
<p>Without freedom from violence and abuse, autonomy and self-determination, inclusion in the community and participation in decision-making, the inherent dignity of the person becomes an empty concept.  The international community needs to acknowledge the extent of these violations, which are broadly accepted and justified in the name of psychiatry as a medical practice.</p>
<p>The concept of ‘medical necessity’ behind non-consensual placement and treatment falls short of scientific evidence and sound criteria. The legacy of the use of force in psychiatry is against the principle ‘primum non nocere’ (first do no harm) and should no more be accepted.</p>
<p>The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities offers a promising occasion for a shift of paradigm in mental health policies and practices. This year’s World Mental Health Day stresses more than ever the need to elaborate new models and practices of community-based services that are respectful of the dignity and integrity of the person.</p>
<p>It is a good timing to take stock of the recent entering into force of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to open a dialogue amongst all stakeholders, including users of services, policy makers and mental health professionals to work on human rights based solutions which may provide answers to the questions brought forward by the Convention’s standards.</p>
<p>We call on States to end all instances of arbitrary detention, forced institutionalisation and forced treatment, to ensure that persons with developmental and psychosocial disabilities are treated with dignity and are provided their rights to have their decisions respected at all times, and to have access to the needed support and accommodation to effectively communicate such decisions.”</p>
<p>(*) World Mental Health Day, which is supported by the United Nations, is annually held on October 10 to raise public awareness about mental health issues worldwide. This year’s theme is: “Dignity in Mental Health.”</p>

		<p>Excerpts from &#8230;</p>
<p>Statement by Mr James Heenan at the CRPD Monitoring Committee Meeting, 14th Session</p>
<p>Mr. James Heenan is Chief, Groups in Focus Section, Human Rights Treaties Division of the OHCHR, United Nations</p>
<p>Geneva, 17 August 2015</p>
<p>All opening statements to the 14th Session of the UNCRPD committee meeting can be found here&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/SessionDetails1.aspx?SessionID=995&#038;Lang=en" rel="nofollow">http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/SessionDetails1.aspx?SessionID=995&#038;Lang=en</a></p>
<p>&#8221; This morning I would like to share some information relating to developments in four areas of relevance to the Committee’s work:</p>
<ul>
<li>the recent meeting of chairpersons of treaty bodies;</li>
<li>the elaboration of the Sustainable Development Goals;</li>
<li>developments at the Human Rights Council; and</li>
<li>recent work of OHCHR on the rights of persons with disabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; I would like to now turn to the on-going intergovernmental process on the Sustainable Development Goals for the post 2015 period. The goals, targets and indicators that are the centrepiece of this initiative have the potential to provide a new and powerful means for addressing some of the chronic human rights situations we face today, such as poverty, discrimination and the lack of access to education to name but a few. This transformative potential of the SDGs, building on the lessons of the MDG process, has been long recognized by the human rights treaty bodies. CRPD, along with other committees, has regularly sounded the call for the new framework be anchored in the internationally agreed human rights norms and standards. This message was reiterated by State parties at the 8<sup>th</sup> Conference of States parties to the Convention, held in New York in June 2015, which focused on the mainstreaming of disability in the post-2015 development agenda.  In his closing remarks,  the President of the Conference noted that the common message among States Parties identified during the Conference was that mainstreaming of disability is an imperative for the new economic and social development agenda.</p>
<p>On Sunday 2 August, Member States endorsed by consensus the Post-2015 Outcome Document: &#8220;Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development&#8221;.  The Outcome Document &#8211; which is available on the website of the President of the General Assembly &#8211; will now be submitted to the Heads of State for adoption at the UN Summit in September.  While not perfect, the text exhibits a number of very welcome human rights features. First and foremost, it is explicitly grounded in the UN Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the international human rights treaties. Further, throughout the preambular language, the goals and the targets, the text offers a universal, integrated and indivisible vision of sustainable development, encompassing key dimensions of all human rights related to both freedom from want as well as freedom from fear. It also puts combatting inequalities, discrimination and exclusion at its heart, and includes a very expansive list of groups to be given special focus, including &#8211; prominently &#8211; persons with disabilities. I would also note that the text specifically addresses issues of accessibility, for example in respect of transport and green spaces. Linked to the identification of groups, another noteworthy feature of the text is the call for disaggregated data as part of the global indicator framework, responding to a key lesson learned from the MDG process. And finally the text outlines an accountability architecture at national, regional and global levels.  Although there remain shortcomings in the extent to which the SGD have embraced human rights, I think all of the elements I have just mentioned should be cause for celebration among the human right community.</p>
<p>&#8230;            Accountability for the SDGs is grounded in the indicators that will measure progress towards the targets and goals . These indicators are currently being deliberated, and a preliminary list of indicators will be published in November 2015, after the adoption of the SDGs. Indicators provide a crucial means of ensuring that human rights lie at the heart of the post 2015 architecture by ensuring that information collected exposes – as far as possible &#8211; the reality on the ground of people’s enjoyment of their human rights. For this reason it is important that human rights voices, including those of the CRPD, are heard in this process.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;            &#8220;On 29 April 2015, just after the conclusion of the Committee’s last session, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention adopted the its text of the &#8220;Basic Principles and Guidelines on remedies and procedures on the right of anyone deprived of their liberty to bring proceedings before a court&#8221;. The new Guidelines contain a separate provision on specific measures for persons with disabilities. That provision, Principle 20, makes it clear that the involuntary committal or internment on the ground of the existence of an impairment or perceived impairment, particularly on the basis of psychosocial or intellectual disability or perceived psychosocial or intellectual disability, is prohibited. The Guidelines also provide that where persons with disabilities are deprived of their liberty through any process, they are, on an equal basis with others, entitled to guarantees in accordance with international human rights law, necessarily including the right to liberty and security of the person, reasonable accommodation, and humane treatment. The basic principles and guidelines will be presented to the Human Rights Council at its 30th session next month.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

		<h1><span style="font-size:small;">Shared by Mari Yamamoto from Japan</span></h1>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:small;">Tokyo Declaration on Community-based Inclusive Development</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">We, the representatives of organizations of persons with disabilities and other non-governmental organizations on Community-based Rehabilitation (CBR)/Community-based Inclusive Development (CBID, also known as CBR), governments, development agencies, donors and the business sector from 46 countries/areas in the Asia-Pacific region and the rest of the world, in total 553 delegates, participated in the third Asia-Pacific CBR Congress on September 1-3, 2015 in Tokyo, Japan. Our special thanks are due to the organizers of the Congress: the CBR Asia-Pacific Network, the Japanese Society for Rehabilitation of Persons with Disabilities (JSRPD) and the Japan NGO Network on Disabilities (JANNET) in collaboration with the partner organizations<a href="http://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/resource/cbr_201509/tokyodeclaration_apcbr2015_en.html#N1" target="_blank">*</a> for their hard work to make the Congress successful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">We appreciate the efforts made by the international community to include disability explicitly in the proposed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which will be adopted by the United Nations as a set of global consensus for poverty reduction in line with the principle of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), the CBR Guidelines, the Incheon Strategy to Make the Right Real (2013-2022) and other international instruments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">CBID is one poverty reduction strategy in terms of the inclusion of persons with disabilities and other marginalized groups in any developmental process, regardless of their economic and social development stage. With such view in relation to the proposed SDGs, the following is recommended by the participants based on the intensive discussions during the Congress:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">1) CBID to be recognized as an effective strategy for achieving the SDGs and leaving no one behind;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">2) CBID to focus on inclusion, peacebuilding, poverty reduction, facilitating community empowerment, introduction and access to customized services, disaster risk reduction, justice for all, and collaboration and mobilization of community resources;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">3) International cooperation on CBID to be strengthened between organizations of persons with disabilities, national and local governments, other partners and stakeholders for building the capabilities of persons with diverse disabilities, and SDGs implementation and progress monitoring at all levels in Asia and the Pacific; and,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">4) The Fourth Asia-Pacific CBR Congress to be convened in Mongolia in 2019.</span></p>
<div><span style="font-size:small;">Presented and unanimously adopted</span></div>

<p>&#8220;CUSP is Critical Psychology in India.<br />
Critical Psychology in India is also about Cultural Psychology.<br />
Cultural Psychology in India is however about a &#8216;critique of culture&#8217; in psychology<br />
(and not just a &#8216;culture of critique&#8217; in psychology).<br />
CUSP is thus about &#8216;critical cultures&#8217; and &#8216;cultural critiques&#8217; in psychology.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first volume is on Violence.</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<p align="justify">Given the focus on mental health to the exclusion of larger socio-cultural (as also political economy) questions, given the study of larger socio–cultural questions to the exclusion of questions of subjectivity and human relationalities, CUSP wishes to engage with questions of mental health and culture-subjectivity in their intimate imbrications. Through such an engagement CUSP wishes to expand and deepen the engagement (a) the field of mental health has at present with questions of culture, and (b) the space social science has at present with questions of intersubjectivity.</p>
<p align="justify">CUSP wishes to rethink the space of culture and subjectivity in their intimate imbrications with questions of mental health (as also to develop in the process an integrated approach to mental health). CUSP is a research initiative that is trying to extend critical human science concerns and questions (that includes questions of culture and subjectivity) to spaces that attend to mental health in terms of research, pedagogy, or alleviation of suffering; it is in turn bringing into human science spaces, concerns, and questions that inhabit the space of mental health. Taking off from the interface, interaction, and integration of the concerns and questions of these two spaces that have hitherto remained separate and alien to each other, CUSP is trying to rethink (and critically reflect upon) the question of mental health in India in the context of questions of culture, subjectivity, and psychic economies. One may immediately ask, what is there to rethink. Is it not enough to just apply the tools we already have (tools that either are derived from the west or are inherited from an Indian past)? Why can’t we just apply existing western thought or apply them at most in a slightly reformed way–reformed so as to suit Indian conditions? Here one must keep in mind that there is consensus on the fact that the existing forms of application are indeed a problem; the mental institutions lack infrastructure and facilities; human rights violation of the sufferer is an added problem. However, there is difference on the solutions that are being offered. Some see it is as a problem of application itself; for them it is an administrative problem; others see it as a problem particular to India. We, on the other hand, see the problem as not a problem just of application but of knowledge; it is not just a problem of the application of (western) tools to (Indian) contexts, but of the very tools (here knowledge) that are being applied (both western and eastern). This sets up the context of the two sets of questions CUSP wishes to engage with. The first concerns larger cultural questions (which include cultures of intimacy, aggression, violence, suffering, and love to name a few) and the second the more circumscribed space of attending to mental health, which in turn could lead to four questions: (1) the question of knowledge; what is it that we are applying? (2) the question of context; where are we applying; what are the different applications that are at work in India? (3) the question of the subject of suffering; on whom are we applying? (4) the question of the subject of knowledge; who is applying?&#8221;</p>

		<p>To,</p>
<p>Shri Awanish Kumar Awasthi JT. Secretary (DePwD) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment New Delhi Dated 1st July, 2015</p>
<p>Subject: Proposed forrmuations on issue of guardianship of adult persons with disabilities. Ref: Parliamentary Standing Committee Report on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Bill</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>We, the persons with disabilities and the persons working for the cause of persons with disabilities listed at the end of this submission have gone through the recommendations of the Standing Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2014. For many persons with disabilities, particularly those with psychosocial and developmental disabilities, a large factor that plays in their marginalization is the lack of recognition of legal capacity. In not reaffirming this right, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2013, has done a great disservice to the principles of the UNCPRD which it seeks to enforce in India. The issue of legal capacity is one which goes to the root of exercise of rights of persons with disabilities, particularly persons with psychosocial and developmental disabilities, and it must be recognized in sans conditions in this legislation which purports to uphold the rights of persons with disabilities. The lack of recognition of legal capacity has led to myriad restrictions upon persons with disabilities in India in personal, contractual, and political spheres. Recently, the Human Rights Watch Report entitled “Treated Worse than Animals: Abuses against Women and Girls with Psychosocial or Intellectual Disabilities in Institutions in India” highlights the lack of legal capacity and enforced guardianship to be a strong factor in the eventual abuse that is meted out to women and girls with disabilities.</p>
<p>Persons with developmental and psychosocial disabilities themselves appeared before the Committee in Chennai expressing their reservations with the laws on guardianship. We are extremely delighted by the observation of the Committee, which we are hereby reproducing as follows:</p>
<p><em>“The Committee note that though the Government have already decided to substitute/recast clause 13(1) and (2) suitably by extending provisions of the clause to all disabled persons yet they feel that there is a possibility of the same going against the right to equality and non-discrimination provisions in the Bill and the Constitution of India as well. The Committee desire the Ministry to have a revisit on the aspect of guardianship and if necessary invite views of some prominent NGOs and stakeholders in the matter.” </em></p>
<p>We submit that from the time of the drafting of the Bill in 2010, the issues surrounding guardianship and the discourse around Article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has evolved immensely. In 2014, a General Comment was released by the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to the following effect:</p>
<p><em>“28. States parties’ obligation to replace substitute decision-making regimes by supported decisionmaking requires both the abolition of substitute decision-making regimes and the development of supported decision-making alternatives. The development of supported decision-making systems in parallel with the maintenance of substitute decision-making regimes is not sufficient to comply with article 12 of the Convention… …While supported decision-making regimes can take many forms, they should all incorporate certain key provisions to ensure compliance with article 12 of the Convention, including the following: (a) Supported decision-making must be available to all. A person’s level of support needs, especially where these are high, should not be a barrier to obtaining support in decision-making; (b) All forms of support in the exercise of legal capacity, including more intensive forms of support, must be based on the will and preference of the person, not on what is perceived as being in his or her objective best interests; (c) A person’s mode of communication must not be a barrier to obtaining support in decision-making, even where this communication is non-conventional, or understood by very few people; (d) Legal recognition of the support person(s) formally chosen by a person must be available and accessible, and States have an obligation to facilitate the creation of support, particularly for people who are isolated and may not have access to naturally occurring support in the community. This must include a mechanism for third parties to verify the identity of a support person as well as a mechanism for third parties to challenge the action of a support person if they believe that the support person is not acting in accordance with the will and preferences of the person concerned; (e) In order to comply with the requirement, set out in article 12, paragraph 3, of the Convention, for States parties to take measures to “provide access” to the support required, States parties must ensure that support is available at nominal or no cost to persons with disabilities and that lack of financial resources is not a barrier to accessing support in the exercise of legal capacity; (f) Support in decision-making must not be used as justification for limiting other fundamental rights of persons with disabilities, especially the right to vote, the right to marry, or establish a civil partnership, and found a family, reproductive rights, parental rights, the right to give consent for intimate relationships and medical treatment, and the right to liberty; (g) The person must have the right to refuse support and terminate or change the support relationship at any time; (h) Safeguards must be set up for all processes relating to legal capacity and support in exercising legal capacity. The goal of safeguards is to ensure that the person’s will and preferences are respected. (i) The provision of support to exercise legal capacity should not hinge on mental capacity assessments; new, non-discriminatory indicators of support needs are required in the provision of support to exercise legal capacity.” </em></p>
<p>It is clear that any law which permits exceptions to independent exercise of legal capacity cannot limited to persons with disabilities alone. This would make it prima facie violative of the CRPD. There are various situations in which persons may require varying levels of support in decision making. In the circumstances, it is prayed that the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Bill may omit all references to guardianship and instead provisions relating to legal capacity may be recast as suggested in the annexure to this submission.</p>
<p>With regard to guardianship, we refer to the proposed National Trust for Providing High Support for Persons with Disabilities Amendment Act of 2011. We call upon the Ministry to hold a consultation as advised by the Hon’ble Committee immediately and consider reviving the drafting of the same, in consultation with persons with disabilities themselves, and recast the existing mechanisms and bodies under the National Trust Act, 1999 to work towards supporting all persons who require assistance in enabling decision making by them in accordance with the observations in the General Comment. To reiterate, this law must make an unequivocal statement guaranteeing the right to legal capacity to all persons, and the regulations regarding the realization of this right must be prioritized by the Ministry.</p>
<p>Thanking you,</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

		<p>Please find below article by Mr. Harsh Mander on caring &#8230;</p>
<p>May 2, 2015 17:15, The Hindu</p>
<p><a href="http://m.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/Harsh_Mander/lessons-in-caring/article7164480.ece" rel="nofollow">http://m.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/Harsh_Mander/lessons-in-caring/article7164480.ece</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Man or woman perched on a waste dump. Covered with grime. Matted, unkempt hair. Nearly naked. Name forgotten. Family forgotten. Muttering inscrutable words. Wandering aimlessly. Solitary. Profoundly lost to the world.</p>
<p>We see many such people in the cities we inhabit. What do they inspire in our hearts? Revulsion? Fear? A fleeting passive pity? Or most likely, just indifference?</p>
<p>Sarbani was different. Heading an international NGO, walking the streets of Kolkata with a psychiatrist friend, she asked him what the fate would be of such people. He replied &#8211; probable lonely, early, anonymous death. She asked him of what they would die. The answer – because they lose the idea of self-care, they may simply die one day of dehydration, of thirst.</p>
<p>Sarbani quit her well-paying job, formed a group of caring young people to work with, registered an organisation called Iswar Sankalpa, and looked for answers to what appeared an unsolvable human tragedy. The answers they found hold extraordinary life-lessons for all of us.</p>
<p>A few decades back, such gravely mentally ill persons would have been incarcerated in high-walled mental hospitals and sometimes in jails, naked and chained, subjected to daily indignities and therapy including electric shocks, locked away from the world. Today it is recognised that these patients should best be cared for in open hospitals and within families.</p>
<p>But what happens to abandoned mentally ill persons who have no family? They endure a double whammy &#8211; of mental illness and homelessness.</p>
<p>Today medical science still has not found a cure for severe psychoses, but within a few weeks, medicines can control nearly all one’s debilitating symptoms, limiting confusions and the chances of self-harm. But who would provide these medicines daily to homeless mentally ill patients who have no one in the world?</p>
<p>The answer which Sarbani and her colleagues proposed was that surely there are caring people in every community, who if identified and educated, could become proxy families of these lost and forgotten souls. They first surveyed the city and found 466 such homeless psychotic patients. They found also that homeless mentally ill people often have a sense of belonging, such as to a particular stretch of pavement.</p>
<p>Eight fine young men and women then set about looking for caring people in these stretches frequented by each of these patients. They soon affirmed that indeed there is no shortage of compassionate people. They found them mostly among working class street vendors, but a few even among the middle classes.</p>
<p>During a night round through the streets of Kolkata in 2007, the team met a near-naked man beside a garbage dump near the Khidderpore flyover, chanting verses from the Koran. Investigating further, they learnt that a grain shopkeeper Mohammed Nihal gave this man lunch every day, even shared his morning tea with him, and gave him clothes. Nihal readily agreed to become his caregiver, and persuaded the man to attend a medical camp. In the camp, he identified himself as Abdullah. The team members bathed him, and a barber agreed to cut his hair and shave him. The doctor diagnosed him with hallucinatory schizoaffective disorder.</p>
<p>Within a month, Abdullah appeared more relaxed. He still communicated in sign language, but after five more months, began to speak. He also started to help Nihal in his shop. As time passed, he recalled that his name was Suresh Kamble, who worked as a radiologist Mumbai’s Nanavati Hospital. But he insisted that he did not want to return to his family, and instead wanted only to stay with Nihal.</p>
<p>I met them seven years later. I found that Suresh was like a member of Nihal’s family, his friend and his most trusted shop assistant. Nihal insisted that his children give Suresh the respect due to any family elder. Nihal only worries what will happen after Suresh’s death. Suresh insists that he should be buried as a Muslim. But Nihal feels he is still a Hindu and should be cremated with Hindu rites. It is one argument that the friends have not resolved.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A homeless, fierce-looking man in his 30s, in tattered, clothes with long tangled hair and beard, unwashed body and malnourished frame restlessly roamed Bijon Setu, the flyover near Ballygunge Railway Station. When field worker Swapan initially approached him, he refused even to speak to him, or accept food or water from his hands. It took Swapan steady and gentle persistence over several weeks to win his trust. Finally he agreed to let Swapan take him to their psychiatrist, who diagnosed him with schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Swapan then looked around for willing caregivers. He found them in Sunil, who operates a soft drinks vending stall, and Kanan Mondal, an ageing widow selling tea under the flyover. Both agreed to help the man. The street barber agreed to cut his hair. He came to called Bijon after the flyover which was his chosen roaming ground.</p>
<p>He gradually accepted medicines, hygiene care, food and counselling therapy and slowly started regaining his memory. He remembered his real name to be Mohammed Asif Iqbal and that he lived in his maternal uncle’s home in Rajabazar. A visit to his home revealed Bijon’s melancholy past. He lost his mother at an early age, and was abandoned in his uncle’s home by his father. Uncared for, he befriended local boys who initiated him into hard drugs. This aggravated his mental health distress further. He was beaten and berated by neighbours and family members, and once arrested by the police.</p>
<p>When I met him some months later, I found Bijon clean, shaven and calm. He still lives at the flyover, as he is unwilling to return home. His memories of abuse and neglect haunt him. He has grown to like and trust his new friends Swapan, Sunil Babu and Kanak Mashi. The afternoon I met him, I found him sitting with them between their stalls. He said to me that he was due to meet another friend. This turned out that a volunteer Anirban, employed in an IT company nearby, who volunteered to visit him during his lunch-break every day. Anirban arrived soon after. In his hands was a packed box of biryani, which he brought to share with Bijon.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I met another caregiver, 18-year-old Sanjay, a pavement tea-seller in the busy commercial area Dhakuria. A middle-aged mentally ill man roamed his pavement, and Sanjay agreed to give him medicines with his tea twice a day. As he recovered, he refused to return to his home. Sanjay spoke to an acquaintance who hires out cycle-rickshaws to rent a rickshaw to Bapida, as he called his new friend. The rickshaw-owner was doubtful. What if he damaged the rickshaw? However, Sanjay stood guarantee for him, and had to mollify the owner for early damages to the rickshaw. But in time, Bapida settled down. He drinks tea with Sanjay, and sleeps on the pavement near his hand-cart at night.</p>
<p>I spoke with Sanjay while he was boiling and pouring out steaming tea expertly to his many customers. I asked him why he did what he did. He smiled a little, then only said, “<i>Bhalo lage</i> (I just like doing this).”</p>
