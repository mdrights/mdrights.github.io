- I have been studying psychology/psychiatry during 2002~2012; 
- I have been a social worker / ethnographer since 2009 and studied Anthropology during 2012~2013;
- I had been using GNU/Linux during my middle-school age, and had got involved in open-source communities since 2014.
- I have been providing online privacy support and anti-surveillance/anti-censorship service for NGOers/activists since 2015.
- I had been a civil monitor to some social policies in China for some time.
