> 一個 Linux/BSD 命令行极客，自由主义者，思考创伤和苦痛、社群和冲突、压迫和自由、民主和暴政。   
A Linux/BSD geek who cannot live without CLI, liberalist, who loves freedom and autonomy. A thinker of trauma and distress, society and conflicts, oppression and freedom.  


## My Experiences  
- I studied psychology/psychiatry during 2005~2010;   
- and studied anthropology and community youth work during 2012~2013;  
- I am a long-time GNU/Linux user and have been long involved in the global free/open-source software communities.  
- I use FOSS only, trying my best to keep away from the big tech, including Tencent and Ali.  
    - Vim+Git is the best IDE in the world.
- I am volunteering in various fields of civil society groups, and providing digital privacy/security/freedom support and anti-surveillance/anti-censorship training/consultation for NGOers/activists as well as the general public.
