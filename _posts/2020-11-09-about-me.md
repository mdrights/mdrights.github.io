I am **MDrights** ( what? ), formerly trained as a clinical psychologist/ethnographer, and now an engineer of GNU/Linux and 'big data', and an enthiusiast of free software movement and online privacy/anti-surveillance. (might be a data analyst for user behaviors in the future -- sounds scared, right?)   

I am also a self-advocate for the rights of people with psychosocial disabilities (with experience of psychiatry in early years).

- I self-dianose me as 'Asperger Syndrome', 'OCD' whilst now such labels could be known as 'geek' (anyway);
- I have been studying psychology/psychiatry since 2002; 
- I have been a social worker / ethnographer since 2009;
- I had been using GNU/Linux during my middle-school age, and had got involved in open-source communities since 2014.
- I have been providing online privacy support and anti-surveillance/anti-censorship service for NGOers/activists since 2015.
- I had been a monitor to some categories of social policies in China/Shenzhen for some time.
