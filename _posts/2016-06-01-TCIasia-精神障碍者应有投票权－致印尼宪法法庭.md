**1.** The Purpose of this Submission to the Constitutional Court of Indonesia, by TCI Asia, is to highlight the importance of political participation, citizenship rights, and the right to participate fully and effectively in all the democratic and governance processes of a country, for the full Inclusion of persons with mental and psychosocial disabilities.

***About TCI Asia***
<!--more-->

**2.** **TCI Asia** (*Transforming communities for Inclusion of persons with psychosocial disabilities, Asia)* is an Asian Alliance of people with psycho-social disabilities, and cross disability supporters, with purpose of advocating the realization of the UNCRPD in the Asian region. It is a regional DPO, striving to enhance the pedagogy and practice of Article 19 (Living Independently and being include in Community) for Asia [1]. TCI Asia has membership in 15 countries, with over 120 members across the region. TCI Asia has fostered a global vision and thinking on Article 19 on Inclusion.

**TCI Asia** is convened by Bapu Trust[2], an organization of persons with psychosocial disabilities in India, with eminent track record of working nationally and regionally, on the fulfillment of all our human rights. The organization participated in the making of the UNCRPD, attended the AdHoc Committee meetings[3], and has valuable academic contributions to the pedagogy and practice of 'Inclusion' in Asian region through the TCI Asia forum. The Bapu Trust works at the grassroots since a decade, providing community based mental health and inclusion services in the low income communities of Pune, India since 2004.

**The Right to Political Participation, a universal Right**

**3.** The right to political participation, and voting rights ensures the full and effective participation of all people within a country, to citizenship, socioeconomic contributions and to nation building. A person excluded from citizenship by denial of political participation faces complete exclusion and faces a 'civil death'. Entry into the arena of Development requires, as a first step, recognition as a person before the law of the land.

4. Like other colonized countries of the Asian region, Indonesia, a post colonial state, has struggled with the issue of political participation since independence; And since then, Indonesia has ratified many important covenants, building an image as a progressive state. Women's right to political participation in Indonesia reflects the struggles of women's movement in other countries in the region, for example, India, to achieve right to adult franchise [4] [5]. Prisoners, and those incarcerated in other institutions, for example, vagrancy homes, have equally struggled to have their right to political participation, and recognition as a voting citizen respected in some parts of Asia, due to a historical baggage of institutionalization and 'trans-institutionalization' of persons rendered 'non-persons' before the law [6]. In India, for example, people with leprosy, the deaf-blind and persons with multiple disabilities, people who were notified by colonial rulers as 'criminal tribes', 'paupers', 'vagrants' and 'renouncers' faced higher risk of civil death, along with people deemed to be 'of unsound mind'. Many of these colonial vestiges in law continue in perverted legal forms in modern law in India, depriving people of their status as legitimate citizens of their countries.

**5.** The International Covenant of Civil Political Rights (ICCPR, which Indonesia has ratified, is categorical in the right to political participation of citizens, as exemplified in Article 25.

> *Every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in article 2 and without unreasonable restrictions: *
>
> *(a) To take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives; *
>
> *(b) To vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors; *
>
> *(c) To have access, on general terms of equality, to public service in his country. *

**6.** It may be that State parties to the ICCPR did not consider ‘disability’ to be a prohibited ground of discrimination, as it is not expressly noted to be so in Article 2[7]. In fact, in the General Comment on Article 25, it was stated that "4. Any conditions which apply to the exercise of the rights protected by Article 25 should be based on objective and reasonable criteria... For example, established mental incapacity may be a ground for denying a person the right to vote or to hold office."[8] Indeed, it is distinctions like these that denied the availability of *all human rights for all persons* that prompted the creation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which addresses the exclusion of persons with disabilities from the protection of established human rights, and also mandates specific State obligations towards respecting, protecting, and fulfilling those rights*. *

**7.** National jurisdictions have sometimes created exceptions to the rule of Universal Adult Franchise on the grounds of disability, particularly those relating to intellectual or psychosocial impairments. While other disability groups face challenges with regard to access to voting materials and ensuring the secrecy of ballots, worldwide, the current legal framework bars access to even enrolment as a voter. In many jurisdictions, *de jure* exclusion happens on account of legislations which bar persons who have been held, by a Court of Law, to be ‘of unsound mind’ from enrolling as voters. It has been the experience that though such disqualification requires a Court order, it results in *de facto* exclusion by authorities who believe that certain individuals, on account of actual or perceived impairment, are of ‘unsound mind’.

**8.** Following the adoption and ratification of the UNCRPD, many countries are reviewing their laws and policies, to bring about compliance. *As the CRPD is a newer treaty and the General Comment No. 25 for ICCPR was issued before the CRPD,* *the CRPD states the correct legal position on contemporary human rights law.* Countries which have not even ratified the UNCRPD, such as the US, continue to set new standards and raising the bar on political participation[9] taking the insights of the UNCRPD.

**9**. Article 29 of the UNCRPD reinstates the unconditional right to political participation that it must be guaranteed to persons with disabilities on *equal basis with others*. To realize this right with regard to State elections, certain State obligations must be adhered to, including ensuring that voting procedures, facilities and materials are appropriate, accessible and easy to understand and use; ensuring that persons with disabilities can vote through secret ballot and without intimidation; protecting the right of persons with disabilities to stand for elections and to be voted for, and to hold office with the support required; and ensuring the free expression of will of persons with disabilities as voters, including, when requested and when necessary, allowing for assistance in voting by a person of their own choice.

**10.** As a political right, Article 29 is to be immediately realized and not progressively. Also, Article 5 of the Convention places upon States the immediate obligation to prohibit all discrimination on the basis of disability and guarantee to persons with disabilities equal and effective legal protection against discrimination on all grounds. In order to promote equality and eliminate discrimination, States Parties shall ensure that *reasonable accommodation* is provided.

**11.** The implications for the full realization of Article 29 for States Parties can be seen from the analysis of the Concluding Observations issued by the UNCRPD Monitoring Committee \[**Annexure A\].** A large majority of the Countries which have been engaged with so far have been advised amendments of laws which prevent persons with disabilities, particularly psychosocial and intellectual disabilities, from voting, or standing for elections. These observations have also been accompanied by strong observations on the need to make voting processes accessible to all persons with disabilities.

**12**. A case which had come to the CRPD Committee through the Optional Protocol from Hungary, involving five individuals under guardianship that were denied the right to vote, drew observations from the Committee that “Article 29 does not foresee any reasonable restriction, nor does it allow any exception for any group of persons with disabilities. Therefore, an exclusion of the right to vote on the basis of a perceived, or actual psychosocial or intellectual disability, including a restriction pursuant to an individualized assessment, constitutes discrimination on the basis of disability, within the meaning of Article 2 of the Convention.”[10]

**13.** State parties are taking remedial measures. The Council of Europe, in their Disability Action Plan 2006-2015, had ‘Participation in Political and Public Life’ as its first Action Line. For this, ‘specific actions’ by member states required States to "\[e\]nsure that no person with a disability is excluded from the right to vote or to stand for election on the basis of her/his disability”. Countries like Canada, South Africa, Netherlands have successfully removed all discrimination on the basis of disability from enrolment as voters.

**14.** Importantly, in the Sustainable Development Goals, the political inclusion of all persons with disabilities has found specific mention in Goal 10: Reducing Inequalities. In the Goal 10 targets, there is the aim to “(b)y 2030, empower and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, **disability**, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status”; and also to “(e)nsure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome, including by eliminating discriminatory laws, policies and practices and promoting appropriate legislation, policies and action in this regard.”

**15.** It is sincerely hoped that the Indonesian Government adopts this progressive approach to ensuring the rights of persons with disabilities and preventing their disenfranchisement. Empowering persons with disabilities as voters is a means to ensure that prospective Governments cater to their needs and aspirations in policy making, and are held accountable for their duty to make the right real with respect to persons with disabilities. Further, opening the doors to citizenship for any group, including the group of persons with disabilities, is strengthening the human capital of the nation.
