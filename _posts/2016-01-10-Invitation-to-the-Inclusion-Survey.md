#### Invitation to the Inclusion Survey

### The Bapu Trust in collaboration with TCI-Asia is compiling a Survey Report on

**‘Good practices on the Inclusion of persons with psycho-social disabilities’**

 covering the Asia region. The report will cover the present status of Inclusion of people with psycho-social disabilities; and  good practices that will facilitate full and effective participation and inclusion in communities.

The survey invites your views on Good Practices on the Inclusion of persons living with (or who have experienced) mental health problems/psycho-social disability. Your participation in this study is crucial to understanding the evolving state of inclusion of persons with psycho-social disabilities: What facilitates their full and effective participation in families and communities?

The survey is an online Google survey. The form is in English, and will take about 20 minutes to fill (not including any translation time that may be involved.)

A big motivation for this study is to find out, what means “Reasonable Accommodation” (RA) for persons with psycho-social disabilities. In the disability movement, implementing RA is considered as key for full and effective participation. What is RA for persons with psycho-social disabilities?

We invite you to participate in the survey. Please also share in your networks, and invite your peers to participate in the google survey.

Shikha Aleya at shikha.aleya@gmail.com is co-ordinating the survey for TCI Asia. Do get in touch with her for any clarifications or questions.
